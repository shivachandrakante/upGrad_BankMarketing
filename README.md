# BankMarketing
This assignment is a programming assignment wherein I built a multiple logistic regression model to classify weather the campaign will be successful or not. I have done this while doing upGrad Data Science certification program.
#Problem Statement 
The data is related to direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed. 

In this project, i have built a model for deciding whether a campaign will be successful in getting a client to sign up for the term deposits.
